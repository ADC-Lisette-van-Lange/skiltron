# IAMA — triggering a fundamental-rights and legal assessment

When a public-sector assistant can affect people — decisions about benefits, permits, debt support, access to services, or any processing of personal data — the team must run a fundamental-rights and legal assessment *before* building and deploying it. In the Netherlands the instrument for the fundamental-rights part is the **IAMA** (Impact Assessment Mensenrechten en Algoritmes); alongside it sit the **DPIA** (AVG), the EU AI Act's **Article 27 fundamental-rights impact assessment (FRIA)**, and obligations under the **Algemene wet bestuursrecht (Awb)**. This skill's job is to **notice when such an assessment is needed, prompt the developer with the right questions, flag the obligations, and route the work to the responsible people** — not to perform or sign off the assessment itself.

## You are the trigger, not the assessor

Be explicit with yourself and the developer: an IAMA is a **multidisciplinary human deliberation** (legal, policy, domain, and affected-group perspectives), and whether something is lawful is a judgement for the organisation's compliance officer, privacy officer (FG/DPO), and legal counsel — not something to certify in code. Your role is to:

- **Detect** that an assessment is likely needed;
- **Ask** the developer the screening questions below, rather than assuming the answers;
- **Flag** which assessments and legal duties apply;
- **Route** the work to the right humans, at the right moment (before build and deploy);
- **Help prepare** — gather inputs, structure the dossier, and turn the legal cross-check into a checklist the humans verify.

Drafting and organising materials is welcome; deciding "this is compliant" is not yours to do.

## When to raise this

Raise it proactively when the assistant (now, or plausibly in a later iteration):

- supports or makes **decisions about people** — eligibility, entitlements, prioritisation, risk scoring, sanctions; or
- processes **personal data**, and especially **special-category** data (health, ethnicity, and so on); or
- affects **access to public services or rights**, or could **disadvantage specific groups**; or
- operates in a **sensitive domain** — benefits, permits, debt help, enforcement, fraud, immigration.

If none of these hold — for example a purely internal developer tool with no personal data and no effect on people — an IAMA is likely not required; say so briefly and move on. When you are unsure, treat it as in scope and ask.

## Screening questions to put to the developer

Ask these in plain language before going further — don't infer them:

1. Who is affected, and can the assistant's output influence a **decision about a person**? Is it information-only, advisory, or decisional?
2. Does it process **personal data**? Any **special-category** data?
3. Could it **disadvantage specific groups** — and how would you detect that if it did?
4. Is there **meaningful human involvement** before any decision takes effect, or could it act automatically? (→ AVG art. 22)
5. What is the **domain and what is at stake** (benefits, permits, enforcement…)?
6. Has a **DPIA** been done or started? Is there an **AI Act risk classification**? (If it looks high-risk, use the `ai-act-high-risk` skill.)

## What the answers imply

- **Personal data involved** → a **DPIA** (AVG art. 35) is likely required; involve the FG/DPO.
- **Effect on fundamental rights or decisions about people** → an **IAMA** is warranted.
- **High-risk under the AI Act and you are a public body (deployer)** → an **Article 27 FRIA** is mandatory before first use and must be notified to the market-surveillance authority. The IAMA can do much of the FRIA's work, but confirm it covers the FRIA's required points (intended purpose, frequency, affected groups, risks, human-oversight and mitigation measures). Hand the classification to the `ai-act-high-risk` skill.
- **Automated decisions without meaningful human involvement** → an AVG art. 22 problem; either build in genuine human intervention or have the exception justified by legal.
- **In every case**: an IAMA on its own is **necessary but not sufficient** — its outcomes must be cross-checked against the concrete legal duties. Walk `references/legal-cross-check.md` with the developer.

## Help assemble the dossier (for the humans to own)

Offer to prepare a **toetsingsdossier** — the file that proves, at an audit or enforcement review, that the analysis was actually done. Structure it from `templates/toetsingsdossier-outline.md`. At minimum: the AI-risk classification with reasoning; the legal cross-check result (what is covered, what is open, with an owner and deadline per open item); the DPIA outcome; the IAMA findings; the human-oversight plan; and the registration evidence (verwerkingsregister, and the EU database where applicable). Keep it at least as long as the system is in use plus five years — ten years for high-risk systems (AI Act art. 18).

## Timing and re-triggering

This is not one-and-done. Raise it again, and reopen the dossier, on any **material change**: a new purpose or use beyond the original; new data sources or system coupling; a wider audience (internal → external, or a new group of citizens); a changed model or version with different outputs; or monitoring signals about bias, errors, or citizen complaints. Record each re-assessment with its date and outcome.

## Pitfalls to name out loud

- **Ticking off an IAMA without the legal cross-check.** The IAMA conversation is valuable but does not automatically cover AVG art. 22 or the AI Act high-risk duties — always do both.
- **Classifying the risk too low.** Doubt about the category points to the *higher* one; the burden of justifying a lower classification sits with the organisation.
- **A stale dossier.** An out-of-date dossier is worse than none — it feigns compliance while the reality has moved on.
- **Human oversight on paper only.** An oversight procedure that nobody actually follows does not count as a safeguard, legally or in practice.
